#### What is Quantum Computing?
* In the last decades of the twentieth century, certain scientists sought to combine two recent theories that were highly influential: 

    **Information Theory** and **Quantum Mechanics**.
* **1984:** Charles Bennet and Gilles Brassad published a quantum key distribution protocol now called **BB84**, allowing two parties to establish an absolutely secure secret key.
---
### What is Quantum Computing?
* **1980s:** Feynman recognized that a system of  
    $n$-particle quantum systems could not be simulated efficiently by a Turing machine, seemingly requiring time/space that is exponential in $n$.
* He proposed that computers based on quantum systems could simulate quantum processes with more efficiency.
---
### What is Quantum Computing?
* This led to the question: If simluating quantum problems was more efficient on a quantum computer, would there be other problems that would run more efficiently on a quantum computer?
* **1994:** Peter Shor found the famous **Shor's Algorithm** for a quantum computer which could factors $n$-digit integers into primes with $n^2$ efficiency (with high probability).

Note: 
The fastest known algorithm in classical computing is of efficiency around $2^{n^{1/3}}$

## A note on notation

* **Dirac's Braâ€“ket notation** is a notation for linear algebra and linear operators on complex vector spaces.
* It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in quantum mechanics, especially those which deal with quantum states and linear transformations.
* We will be using it extensively and will progressively explain how it works.

# Qubits
* The computers we use today rely on classical information theory, which are based on 'bits' which can represents a 0 or 1 state.
* These computers (which will be referred to as **classical computers**) are equivalent to a Turing Machine in computational efficiency.
* Classical computers are based on bits, which are systems that can take on two
states.
