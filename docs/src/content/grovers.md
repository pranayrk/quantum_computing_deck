### Grover's Algorithm

> Consider a set $X$ with $N$ elements and let $f: X \to \\{ 0,1 \\}$ be a boolean function such that $f(x) = 1$ for exactly one element $x_0 \in X$.  
> Find the element $x_0$.

* Classical algorithms have a time complexity of $O(N)$
* Grover's algorithm solves this problem with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$

> Find the element $x_0$.

* First presented by Lov Kumar Grover as a database search algorithm
* The problem statement represents an unstructured search problem 
* Grover's algorithm is proven to be optimal
