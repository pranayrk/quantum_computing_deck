# Qubits
* The computers we use today rely on classical information theory, which are based on 'bits' which can represents a 0 or 1 state.
* These computers (which will be referred to as **classical computers**) are equivalent to a Turing Machine in computational efficiency.
* Classical computers are based on bits, which are systems that can take on two
states.
