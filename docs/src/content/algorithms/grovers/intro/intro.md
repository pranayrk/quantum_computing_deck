### Key Points
* Published by Lov Kumar Grover in 1996
* One of the most famous quantum algorithms
* Targets an unstructured search problem
* Does not have as impressive of a speedup as Shor's
* Applicable to a broader range of problems than Shor's
* Finds the solution with high probability in quadratic time
* Original paper introduces it as a database search algorithm

Note:
* Shor's has an exponential speedup while Grover's has only quadratic speedup
* Grover's algorithm could brute-force a 128-bit symmetric cryptographic key in roughly $2^64$ iterations, or a 256-bit key in roughly $2^128$ iterations.
