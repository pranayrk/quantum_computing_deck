### Key Points
* Devised by Lov Kumar Grover in 1996
* One of the most famous quantum algorithm second to only Shor's algorithm
* Does not have as impressive of a speedup as Shor's but is applicable to a broader range of problems

Note:
Shor's has an exponential speedup while Grover's has only quadratic speedup
