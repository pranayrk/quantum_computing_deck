### Key Points
* Devised by Lov Kumar Grover in 1996
* One of the most famous quantum algorithm second to only Shor's algorithm
* Does not have as impressive of a speedup as Shor's but is applicable to a broader range of problems
* Targets an unstructured search problem and finds the solution with high probability
* Original paper introduces it as a database search algorithm but it finds limited use in this case

Note:
* Shor's has an exponential speedup while Grover's has only quadratic speedup
* Grover's algorithm could brute-force a 128-bit symmetric cryptographic key in roughly $2^64$ iterations, or a 256-bit key in roughly $2^128$ iterations.
