##### Principle of Transformation
> Any change in the state of a qubit can be described by the action of a unitary transformation

A unitary transformation is a linear isomorphism that preserves the inner product.

This can be represented by a unitary matrix $U$ where $$U U^\dagger = U^\dagger U = I$$
