## A note on notation

* **Dirac's Braâ€“ket notation** is a notation for linear algebra and linear operators on complex vector spaces.
* It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in quantum mechanics, especially those which deal with quantum states and linear transformations.
* We will be using it extensively and will progressively explain how it works.
