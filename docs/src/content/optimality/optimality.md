### Optimality of Grover's Algorithm

> Consider we have an unstructured search problem with possible solutions $1, 2, ..., N$ which has exactly one solution $k \in \\{1, 2, ..., N \\}$. Let each possible solution correspond to a basis vector in a quantum state space as $\\{\ket{1},\ket{2}, ..., \ket{N} \\}$ and we have access to a phase oracle $\boxed{U_\pm}$. Any algorithm that returns the output $\ket{k}$ must call the oracle on the order of $\sqrt{N}$ times.
