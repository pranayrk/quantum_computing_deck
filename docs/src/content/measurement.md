### Foundations of Quantum Computing
##### Principle of Measurement
Consider the qubit in state $\ket{\psi} = a \ket{0} + b \ket{1}$ and a measurement device calibrated to the computational basis

> The action of measurement causes the state of the qubit to collapse into either $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ which will be output of measurement

The probability of measuring $\ket{0}$ is $|a|^2$ and the probability of measuring $\ket{1}$ is $|b|^2$
