> The state of every qubit can be represented by a unit vector in a 2-dimensional complex Hilbert space

The state is normally described with respect to the **computational basis** $\\{ \\; \ket{0}, \ket{1} \\; \\} $
where 

$\ket{0} = 1 + 0 i = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\ket{1} = 0 + 1 i = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
